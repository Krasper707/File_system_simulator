# File System Command Simulator

## Overview

This is a simple command-line file system simulator written in C++. It allows users to execute basic file system operations such as creating directories, changing directories, listing contents, creating files, and removing files. The program continuously runs in a loop, processing user input until the exit command is issued.

## 🛠 Features

- mkdir [directory] → Creates a new directory.

- ls → Lists directory contents.

- cd [directory] → Changes the current directory.

- touch [file] → Creates a new file.

- rm [file] → Removes a file.

- exit → Exits the program.


## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement rm -r for recursive directory deletion
- Support file content editing with echo or append.

- Implement persistent storage (saving/loading state).
